# Application Manager

## Description
This is a simple application manager built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It is designed to monitor apps and assign tasks.

## Features
- **App Monitoring**: Keep track of all your applications in one place.
- **Task Assignment**: Easily assign tasks to different applications.

## Usage
1. Download and install a local server software like XAMPP or any other software that supports PHP.
2. Activate the Apache and MySQL services through the control panel of your server software.
3. Place the application folder in the 'htdocs' directory of your server software.
4. Navigate to the index route (usually `http://localhost/your-folder-name`) in your web browser to start using the app.
5. Before you start, you will need to create a MySQL database. This can be done using the 'db' file located inside the application folder. Import this file into your MySQL service (through phpMyAdmin or similar tool) to set up the required database.
